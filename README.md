Just playing around with some plainJS
To learn how the different frameworks stack up against each other, I plan to build the application in the following versions: 
1. pure client side JS
2. Client side (plainJS) and Server side (nodeJS + MongoDB)
3. Client side (React) and Server side (nodeJS + MongoDB)
