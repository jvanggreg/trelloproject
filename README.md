# trelloproject
Hi, it has been quite a few years since I last touched any code. But I want to get back into it as I miss building stuff. 

This project is me building a Trello clone to learn how the different frameworks stack up against each other, 

I plan to build the application in the following versions: 
1. Client side JS (plainJS) as a SPA
2. Client side (plainJS) and Server side (nodeJS + MongoDB)
3. Client side (React) and Server side (nodeJS + MongoDB)

Please feel free to have a look, however I doubt you will find it to be at any advanced level or pretty
